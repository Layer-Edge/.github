# LayerEdge

Bitcoin has set the standard for decentralized financial systems with its security. However, its inherent limitations, such as constrained block sizes and slower transaction speeds, have sparked a quest for innovative solutions that can unlock its full potential as a decentralized global currency. Concurrently, Ethereum has redefined the blockchain landscape by introducing a Turing-complete programming language, fostering an ecosystem brimming with decentralized applications that test the limits of its scalability.

While Ethereum envisions a future of EVM-compatible chains stacked to enhance scalability, with its parent chain as the ultimate settlement layer, it grapples with its own set of challenges, including centralization concerns and scalability bottlenecks. In this dynamic landscape, the quest for a foundational layer that combines the security and decentralization of Bitcoin with the flexibility and scalability of Ethereum is more pressing than ever.

LayerEdge emerges as a solution in this context, offering a layer 2 protocol that leverages Bitcoin's unmatched security and Ethereum's smart contract versatility. Unlike existing layer 2 solutions, which often involve trade-offs in terms of decentralization or scalability, LayerEdge is designed to offer the best of both worlds, enabling rapid, cost-effective, and scalable applications without compromising on decentralization.
